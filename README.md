# SaaS (Software as a Service) Data Analysis

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to analyze subscription data for a SaaS platform. We aim to understand user behavior, track feature adoption, analyze feedback, and calculate revenue breakdowns. The analysis helps the company to make informed decisions regarding subscription plans, feature development, and customer satisfaction.

## Tools and Technologies Used
### Database: PostgreSQL
### Language: 
SQL (including recursive queries, window functions, stored procedures)
### Analysis Tools: 
SQL for querying data, calculating metrics, and generating reports.

## Data Download and Modification
The data used in this project was generated and modified to fit the needs of the analysis. The following datasets were used:

### Users: Information about users, their subscription plans, and signup dates.
### Features: List of SaaS platform features and their descriptions.
### Usage: User activity data related to feature usage.
### Payments: Subscription payment details for users.
### Feedback: User feedback on the platform.
These datasets were downloaded and customized to simulate real-world SaaS platform data. The data was structured and normalized in PostgreSQL tables, allowing for complex querying and analysis.


## Problems Solved
### Subscription Management: 
Track subscription payments, update user statuses, and calculate total revenue from different plans.
### Usage Tracking: 
Monitor which features are being used by different users and calculate adoption rates for features.
### Feedback Analysis: 
Collect and analyze user feedback, calculate average ratings by subscription plan to gauge platform satisfaction.
### Revenue Analysis:
